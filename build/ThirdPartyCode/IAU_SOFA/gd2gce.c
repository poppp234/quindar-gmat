**
**  Transform geodetic coordinates to geocentric for a reference
**  ellipsoid of specified form.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     a       double     equatorial radius (Notes 1,4)
**     f       double     flattening (Notes 2,4)
**     elong   double     longitude (radians, east +ve)
**     phi     double     latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 4)
**     height  double     height above ellipsoid (geodetic, Notes 3,4)
**
**  Returned:
**     xyz     double[3]  geocentric vector (Note 3)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int         status:
**                            0 = OK
**                           -1 = illegal case (Note 4)
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The equatorial radius, a, can be in any units, but meters is
**     the conventional choice.
**
**  2) The flattening, f, is (for the Earth) a value around 0.00335,
**     i.e. around 1/298.
**
**  3) The equatorial radius, a, and the height, height, must be
**     given in the same units, and determine the units of the
**     returned geocentric vector, xyz.
**
**  4) No validation is performed on individual arguments.  The error
**     status -1 protects against (unrealistic) cases that would lead
**     to arithmetic exceptions.  If an error occurs, xyz is unchanged.
**
**  5) The inverse transformation is performed in the function
**     iauGc2gde.
**
**  6) The transformation for a standard ellipsoid (such as WGS84) can
**     more conveniently be performed by calling iauGd2gc,  which uses a
**     numerical code (1 for WGS84) to identify the required a and f
**     values.

**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The name(s) of all routine(s) in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau".
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
